# r-baseball
An R module for importing and working with baseball data

Ultimately, the files in this repo should be used to automate the creation of an R package which includes common
baseball data sources and utilities for working with data. As of Feb 2016, this is still very much a work in
progress.

# HOWTO Build the package

Run the script extract/download.groovy to download and extract raw data (CSV files):
```
groovy download.groovy
```

Run the script Baseball.R to build R package (PENDING):
```
Rscript Baseball.R
```
